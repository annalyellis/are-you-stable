    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
    <p>We have created 5 static visualizations as part of the exploratory
      data analysis process. Using these, we will come up interesting, interactive
    ways to visualize the data. We have plans to make it interactive in that one 
  could test their own balance. We may involve a camera or some sort of test where the 
  viewer is able to take a test and see how different aspects of their balance compare
  to others. In addition to this, we will also make visualizations that convey informations
  about the trends present in the data. Through both of these types of visualizations, the viewer 
  should be able to learn about both their own stability and human balancing capabilites in general.</p>
